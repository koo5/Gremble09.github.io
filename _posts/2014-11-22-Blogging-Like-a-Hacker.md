##Hello, world!

Want to be a hacker yourself? [How to become a Hacker](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html). Now back to some more serious business.  

I have decided to try and set up a blog because I need both writing practise and a practical reason to learn to use HTML and CSS. I would be lying if I said that I enjoyed messing around with the design of this blog. CSS is incredibly finicky and I still have some minor kinks to sort out. I am most certainly not a frontend designer.  

On the technical aspects of the site, it is hosted by GitHub with their pages facility. It is run on Jekyll. Jekyll is a static site generator that is blog aware, meaning I can create files and save them in a folder called _posts and Jekyll turns them into blog posts for me. All very clever and quite simple once you have it set up. All I have to do is fill it with sensible content.  

The theme for the site, I stole from http://jekyllthemes.org/. It is called simply grey theme. There are a couple of oddities with it.  Firstly, it proudly calls itself JavaScript free, but it has calls to pull the ajax API down and includes bootstrap.min.js. The original maintainer of the theme also ceased to exist. The site should be responsive, meaning that it should look fine on any device that you point to it. In the near future I hope to have it all set up and looking pretty.
