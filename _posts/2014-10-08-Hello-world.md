title: Blogging Like a Hacker

Hello, World!
=============

After some effort I think I have finally gotten this blogging thing set up.  I've made this platform so that I can showcase some of my projects, write a little and share some of what I know in a on a more permanent platform.

This site is set up on a Jekyll base hosted on GitHub.  Thanks to Jekyll I can write posts using markdown, which gets rendered into HTML.  With some clever tricks from the liquid templating engine, I can then add all the preamble to the posts so that CSS and all the other pretty things get added.

The documentation on the Jekyll page is fantastic already, so I will not bore anyone by redoing documentation that has been done already.
